In this section we present the schedule for the next 6 months. It is shown in Table \ref{tab:schedule}.

%Month  & Work to be done \\
\\\midrule
January-February        &Based on the initial reviews from AISTATS, 2017 we have made further modifications to the ClusUCB algorithm and came up with Efficient ClusUCB algorithm. We will submit to ICML, 2017. \\\midrule
January-February	&We will also want to come up with a short version of our AugUCB algorithm for the thresholding bandit problem for IJCAI, 2017.\\\midrule
March-June	&Based on the two sets of reviews we wish to work further on these two setups. I also wish to work on restless bandits where these two algorithms can be applied (see \cite{garivier2011upper}).\\\midrule
