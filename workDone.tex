\begin{enumerate}
\item On four synthetic setups with small gaps, we observe empirically that ClusUCB outperforms UCB-Improved (\cite{auer2010ucb}) and MOSS (\cite{audibert2009minimax}) as well as other popular stochastic bandit algorithms such as DMED (\cite{honda2010asymptotically}), UCB-V (\cite{audibert2009exploration}), Median Elimination (\cite{even2006action}), Thompson Sampling (\cite{agrawal2011analysis}) and KL-UCB (\cite{garivier2011kl}). The results can be seen in Appendix \ref{AppendixA} section. We also prove strong theoretical guarantees for Clustered UCB, and the manuscript is currently under review in AISTATS 2017.
\item We have started work on AugUCB algorithm and are currently trying to prove it's simple regret bounds. Empirically the algorithm has performed well and the result is shown in Appendix \ref{AppendixB}.
